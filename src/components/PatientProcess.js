          Thank you for wanting to take care of your dental health with us,
          there is a few things we'd love for you to know about prior to the
          first visit.

        <h4>Step Two</h4>
        <h1>Get to know you</h1>
        <p>
          During your first visit, we will review your dental history and take
          necessary X-rays of your teeth and mouth. Then, the doctor will meet
          with you to help you create your own individual treatment plan, and
          answer any questions that you may have.
        </p>

        <h4>Step Three</h4>
        <h1>Regular Checkups</h1>
        <p>
          The ADA recommends visiting your dentist at least every six months for
          regular checkups and routine cleanings to keep your teeth and gums
          healthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We understand that life is busy, so when youâ€™re preparing for your
          visit to Sunshine Dental, please note that your appointments can last
          between 45 and 90 minutes.
